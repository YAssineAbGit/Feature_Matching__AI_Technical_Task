# Yepic_AI_Technical_Task

## How to run the code:
To run the code, execute the Yepic_Workflow_python.ipynb by double-clicking it.

## Yepic_AI_Technical_Task
The task is to figure out mapping from one item of clothing to another item of clothing and generate a mapping that matches points from one image to another image in a slightly different (warped) position.

## Criteria:
- [x] Code legibility—i.e. do we understand the code by itself by just looking at it and comments?
- [x] Reproducibility—i.e. will we get roughly the same results?
- [x] Critical analysis—i.e. have you done enough to understand what types of models 
- [x] Documented research process—i.e. do we understand what steps you have taken and what experiments you have run? What worked? What did not work?
- [x] Originality—i.e. have you moved at least a bit beyond the tutorials we can find online?
